    "This work contains some results that were obtained while writing a comment about a recent study by [Witz *et al.* (2019)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48063). The numerical analysis for those results is also available in this repository. Refers to the corresponding [index](response_Witz2019_index.ipynb) to navigate through this work. This led to a series of exchanges:\n",
